# Single Core Optimization - Exercises



In this folder we collect the examples about the topics covered in the lectures on code optimization.

We articulate the examples by topic:

1. **cache** : basic directions on how to write cache-friendly code, and examples that clarify the impact of missing the opportunity
2. **branches** : the effect of the conditional evaluation inside loops, and how to mitigate/avoid it
3. **loops** : how to write loops so that to exploit the super-scalarity of your cores (with mixed techniques from cache- and branches- topics)
